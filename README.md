### :sunglasses: About Me:
I am a passionate Software Engineer focusing on React, Next JS, TypeScript, MongoDB, and MySQL to build full stack apps and solve complex problems. I have professional experience in the tech industry, having worked in product management at the Royal Academy of Arts for the past year. 

Our tech stack includes Next JS, React, Ruby, MySQL, C# and other technologies. I carry out testing and quality assurance, getting involved in component testing, e2e testing, and more. Achievements include working on a Bloomberg funded project to refresh the RA's frontend, and working closely with the tech lead to regularly pick up tickets to fix bugs and deploy to Github, using continuous integration with Github Actions.

I also helped refactor an automated JavaScript testing app called Testbot, using JS library Puppeteer and Node to automate and test user flows through different sections of the website, and post to Slack if any errors are detected.

I am an alumni at The Jump Digital School, where i took their 5 month Professional JavaScript + Dev Ops course to further my skill set to a professional level.

I also have experience as a freelance developer for a small design studio. I enjoy building websites for clients that help them expand their work and businesses to wider audiences. I love the continous learning journey that web development provides, and I continue to grow and improve.

I have extensive experience in the arts, so I would like a software engineer job in this industry, but I am generally open to any role or industry.
